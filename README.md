## 📖 About The Project

This repository hosts the official static website and legal documentation platform for **NotesNest**, a comprehensive productivity application for Android devices. NotesNest is designed to help users capture thoughts, track daily checklists, structure future targets, and manage reminders with ease. 

This portal serves as the primary landing presence for NotesNest, offering deep product documentation, support pipelines, and high-fidelity regulatory policy pages (Privacy, Terms, Deletion) required by the Google Play Console for privacy disclosures.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Aesthetic Presentation**: Introduce the Android app's clean features to visitors using premium, modern UI cards and layouts.
* **Documentation Hub**: Offer a fully interactive, mobile-optimized User Guide for app operations.
* **Compliance Assurance**: Display GDPR/CCPA-compliant privacy statements and terms with a highly readable visual hierarchy.
* **Interactive Pipelines**: Empower users to file structured bug reports, suggest feature additions, or initiate secure account deletion.

---

## ✨ Features & Architecture

The portal has been developed using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and modern Javascript, implementing professional-grade UI components:

### 📄 Core Pages Included
* **Home (`index.html`)** — Premium landing viewport with side-by-side CTA controls, LCP-optimized hero image loading (`fetchpriority="high"`), responsive cards grids, and interactive FAQ accordions.
* **User Guide (`user-guide.html`)** — Fully indexed product user guide. Features sticky horizontal navigation pills on tablets, and a sliding drawer menu triggered via a floating action button on mobile screens.
* **Privacy Policy (`privacy.html`)** — Premium legal breakdown containing a frosted glassmorphism Ads Policy card (`backdrop-filter: blur(4px)`) and a pure HTML/CSS live status dashboard simulating third-party integration points.
* **Terms of Service (`terms.html`)** — Edge-to-edge dark hero banner with golden accents, layered badge seals (gold check on black certificate), notice blockquotes, and highly structured, custom grid summaries for Sections 2 through 9.
* **Account Deletion (`delete.html`)** — A clean multi-step decommissioning funnel with warning headers, white card pre-deletion checklists, detailed data deletion matrices, and a gold-bordered Primary Action Card.
* **Bug Report (`bug-report.html`)** — A fully structured form for reporting app defects, featuring a center-aligned workflow grid on desktop.
* **Feedback & Contact (`feedback.html`, `contact.html`)** — Interactive input controls and clean grid resources.

### 🎨 Visual & Performance Engineering
* **Premium Theme**: Tailored using a curated, custom color system (vibrant gold `#ffd000`, dark-brown accents `#856d1a`, charcoal backgrounds, and light warm gray cards `#f6f5f3`).
* **Micro-Animations**: Features smooth transition triggers on hover states, accordion toggles, and drawer sliders.
* **UX Safety**: Secure outbound links (`target="_blank" rel="noopener"`) configured project-wide to mitigate reverse tabnabbing and secure session navigation.
* **Responsiveness**: Re-engineered page grids, navigation, and tables to guarantee 100% fluid layouts from small viewport mobile screens up to wide desktop monitors.
